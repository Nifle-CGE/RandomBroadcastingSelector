    You are about to experience greatness. Right now, so much power is in your hands.<br>
    But as they always say in the movies : "With great power comes great responsability".<br>
    I imagine you already have what you are going to say sorted out so before writing your wonderful message to the
    {{ stats["users"]["num"] }} people that signed in to website, make sure the awnsers to the following questions are
    all no.
</h3>
<h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Is your message harassing, insulting or encouraging hate against anyone ?</li>
        <li>Is your message using too much mild language for a family friendly website ?</li>
        <li>Does your message contain any link (like "http://example.com") or pseudo link (like "example.com")
            or attempts at putting a link that doesn't look like one (like "e x a m p l e . c o m" or "example
            dot com") ?</li>
